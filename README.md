# Community
Welcome to the Terp Network community!

SubDaos are the sub-units of how Terp DAO advances its purpose. A subDao is a group of people actively working on tasks that align with Terp Networks Constitutional Values and community run initiatives. As such, ratifying subdaos sets boundaries on what is and isn't in scope for Terp Network DAO's governance.

## SubDAO Formation Process

SubDao can be formed through the Terp Network Proposal Framework. The proposal process can be read more in-depth here and the proposal must include the SubDao component template. The burden falls mostly on the proposers of the sub-DAO, i.e., the sub-DAO must convince the Terp Network Community to fund its operations and support its mission. In other words, the sub-DAO should lobby for its formalization and funding proposal to pass.

A great way to build trust within the community is to operate informally first.

## SubDao Stages
SubDaos have five potential states. Each of the five states and the requirements for a subdao in each state are outlined below:

- **Informal:** The subdao is not funded by the DAO, and has not made a formal proposal with its goals and a budgetary request.
- **Proposed:** The subdao has made a formal proposal to the DAO for a working budget.
- **Active:** The subdao is active and funded by the DAO.
- **Inactive:** The subdao has been discontinued and is no longer being funded by the DAO.

## SubDAO Repo
This repository is intended to be used by Terp Network subDAOs to organize and document their work. Each subdao should have a folder in this repository with a README.md file that describes the subDAO's purpose and work. The README.md file should also include a list of subDAO members and a link to the subDAO's meeting notes.
