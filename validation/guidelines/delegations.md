# Delegation Guidelines

NOTE: These guidelines are not in action until consensus & creation of the Validation Delegation SubDAO.


## Delegations SubDAO Inception

The Validation Delegations SubDAO (VDS) is a part of the Validation SubDAO, to be proposed through both Terp Network & the validation subDAO governance processes.

## Why do we have a Delegation SubDAO?

The three core components of any distributed proof of stake blockchain are delegators, validators and the founding team. As the blockchain matures, additional roles are required to assist with community engagement and support to build on foundations set from genesis. Typical members/roles added include developers, marketing managers, and community managers. As Terp Network is a DAO-based blockchain, managing delegations to validators from the Foundation DAO can been (primarily) moved from the founding team (aka "Foundation DAO") to the Validation Delegation SubDAO.

## The objectives of the VDS are:

- To provide the Validation Subdao within an ongoing income stream from staking rewards which will be used for future development of the Terp Network. 
- To reward validators that contribute to Terp Network, via staking TERP with them, which provides a continual revenue stream via comission. 

## Who can apply for the delegations program?
Any entity running a validator node on the Terp Network that satisfies the minimum requirements outlined in section 2.1

## How can a delegator apply for a delegation?
By submitting a delegation request here. The form will only be open for submissions during delegation application collection periods. These periods will be announced on the @TerpCulture Twitter account.

## Delegation Epoch
Delegations will be made for a set period. This period is known as an epoch. The epoch will be marked by a Terp Network block number which will be provided after applications are scored and delegations are made. The epoch length is determined by the subdao. 

## Determination of individual delegation amounts
The total amount that will be delegated to each validator will be a function of the total amount allocated to be delegated by the Validation Delegation SubDAO, the total score earned by the validator (resultant from assessment of application), and the points multiplier to be applied as per section 1.8.
